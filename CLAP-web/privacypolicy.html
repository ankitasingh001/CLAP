<h1> Informed Consent: Terms </h1>
CLAP (Crowdsourcing for Language Processing) was built and is currently
maintained by a group of students and faculty at the Department of
Computer Science at IIT Bombay. Our objective is to build speech-driven
technologies for Indian languages, for which we require large volumes of
speech with corresponding transcriptions. This resource is sadly
unavailable for most of the Indian languages. To address this issue, we
have built CLAP which is a crowdsourced app that will enlist the help of
native speakers of various Indian languages to read out text in their own
native tongues and verify such text-to-speech conversions done by others.
<br><br>
As a user of CLAP, you will be asked to read out sentences in various
Indian languages. Your speech clips will be stored on IIT Bombay servers.
However, they will be completely anonymized and no identifying information
about you will be stored with the data. Once we have a sufficient amount
of speech data for various Indian languages, we plan to release this as a
publicly available speech corpus for researchers. We hope this will
facilitate further research on developing technologies for Indian
languages.
<br> <br>
Please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:clap.iitb@gmail.com">clap.iitb@gmail.com</a> if you have any
questions about the app or the research.

If you proceed further and use this app, we will treat this as a
confirmation that you have read and understood the following terms:
<ol>
<li>That you are voluntarily agreeing to participate in the project.</li>
<li>That you can stop using the app at any time without any penalty.</li>
<li>That the procedures regarding confidentiality have been clearly explained.</li>
<li>That the user of the data in research, sharing and archiving has been explained.</li>
<li>That your speech clips will form part of a speech corpus where your
responses will be completely anonymized and no personal information will
be revealed.</li>
</ol>
We thank you in advance for contributing speech samples and helping build
technologies for Indian languages!
